# Alternate-Credit-Score-
  This program will create and run an alternate credit score on various indivduals to see if they are 'risky' clients or not.<br />
I will create the data needed in an sqlite database and use tkinter for the GUI. The alternative credit score that I will be<br />
implementing will range from 100-800. 800 being excellent and 100 being terrible. 

  The factors that are making up the credit score will be: <br />
    -bank overdrafts<br />
    -insurance payments<br />
    -child support and or alimony<br />
    -household utility payments<br />
    -cell phone payments<br />
    -rent payments<br />
    
  Each late payment will resort in subtracting points from their score and, on-time payments will add to their score. To make the scoring<br />
  a but more simple, I will only be using two months worth of payments.<br />
  P.S. I will give instructions on how to run the program after it is made :)
